\chapter{Introduction}
\noindent The digital transformation of educational institutions has created new opportunities for integrating analytics and gamification in order to improve learning outcomes.
The Learning Scorecard (LS) platform embodies this approach, merging business intelligence with educational strategies to monitor and enhance student engagement and performance.

This thesis presents the development of the Learning Scorecard v2.5: a
prototype plugin that integrates some of the major features of the previous LS
iterations with the Moodle Learning Management System Service API.\@

\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Learning Management Systems}
\noindent Learning Management Systems (LMS) represent sophisticated software applications engineered to administer, track, report, automate, and deliver educational courses, training programs, and comprehensive learning materials. Following their initial emergence in the late 1990s, these platforms have achieved near-universal adoption across higher education institutions globally. Recently, the unprecedented expansion of LMS usage has been significantly accelerated by the institutional shift toward remote learning by the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are a plethora of LMS available for educational institutions, with ommercial and open-source platforms representing the two primary categories of LMS offerings~\cite{mohd_kasim_choosing_2016}. Commercial LMS are either available in the market for a price or, although very rarely, proprietary and developped by the institution. In contrast, the open source alternative is available at no cost to the institution, although technical expertise is required aswell as regular functional assessments. Open-source systems provide publicly accessible source code that institutions can modify and improve to meet their specific requirements and needs \cite{cavus_comparison_2014}.

Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) stands as one of the most widely adopted open-source learning management systems globally. According to a recent systematic review on tendencies in the use of LMS, Moodle is the most popular and preferred open-source LMS~\cite{altinpulluk_systematic_2021}. The platform's extensive reach is evidenced by its current deployment across 238 countries, serving approximately 468 million users worldwide~\cite{moodle_stats_2025}.

From a technical perspective, Moodle is built on a layered architecture that ensures flexibility and scalability. The presentation layer handles the user interface and allows users to interact both on desktop and mobile devices. The application layer accommodates core functionalities and acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data layer, supporting the installation of plugins and modules to customize features. The data layer includes the database management system, typically SQL-based, which stores and manages all the data. This modular design allows institutions to customize the functionality and appearance through a extensive plugin ecosystem.

\chapter{The Learning Scorecard: Concept and Evolution}
\section{Genesis and Conceptualization of the Learning Scorecard}
\noindent The Learning Scorecard emerged from a fundamental pedagogical challenge identified within higher educational institutions: the lack of understanding by faculty members regarding the difficulties experienced by students in relations to the content taught in curricular units aswell as the students disinterest and lack motivation. Initially, this platform was conceptualized as a comprehensive academic performance management system designed to support both students and faculty through data-driven insights that assist educators in continuously monitoring the curricular units they teach while enabling students to visualize their performance in each course in which they are enrolled. Their main mission was to offer higher education students an analytic environment that allows progress monitorization in a curricular unit, contributing for a better learning experience.

The platform was originally conceptualized with three distinct user perspectives: student view, teacher view, and administrative view. The student view provides essential visualizations that enable students to understand their learning trajectory in a specific curricular unit while offering tools that provide important data for continuous monitoring by faculty. The teacher view provides management, evaluations and visualization tools for educators regarding each curricular unit they teach, offering various visualizations to track each students progress through all phases of the curricular unit along with assessment tools.

\section{Evolution Through Iterative Development}
\subsection{Historical Overview of Versions}
\noindent The Learning Scorecard development followed a systematic timeline beginning in the 2015/16 academic year by a groupp of Computer Science masters students attending the Informatic Systems of Decision Support II curricular unit. The platform evolved through \textbf{X} major versions, each incorporating lessons from previous iterations and expanding functionality based on user feedback.

\textbf{Learning Scorecard Version 2 (2017)}

\textbf{Learning Scorecard Version 3 (2018)}

\subsection{Lessons Learned from Prior Iterations}
\section{Learning Scorecard Conceptual Framework}

The Learning Scorecard (LS) conceptual framework encompasses a comprehensive set of interconnected concepts designed to support gamified learning experiences in higher education. These concepts can be organized into four primary domains: Academic Structure, Gamification Mechanics, Social Learning, and Performance Recognition.

\subsection{Academic Structure and Organization}

The academic foundation of the Learning Scorecard is built upon traditional higher education organizational structures, adapted to support digital learning environments.

\textbf{Courses and Curricular Units.} The system recognizes a two-tier academic structure where \textit{Courses} represent overarching academic programs (e.g., "Computer Science") that encompass multiple \textit{Curricular Units}. Each Curricular Unit corresponds to an individual subject with specific learning objectives, content, and assessments that students must complete as part of their academic progression. This hierarchical organization maintains consistency with traditional academic frameworks while enabling digital tracking and gamification.

\textbf{Students and Faculty.} The system accommodates two primary user roles: \textit{Students}, who are enrolled in one or more Curricular Units and participate in gamified learning activities, and \textit{Teachers} or Faculty members, who are responsible for creating and managing curricular content, designing learning activities, and monitoring student progress within their assigned Curricular Units.

\textbf{Syllabus Contents, Calendar and Timeline.} \textit{Syllabus Contents} encompass all learning materials, resources, and educational content within a Curricular Unit. The organizational framework includes both \textit{Calendar} and \textit{Timeline} concepts that serve as complementary planning systems, enabling students and faculty to organize learning activities and maintain temporal awareness of curricular progression.

\subsection{Gamification Mechanics}

The core gamification elements provide the foundation for student engagement and progress tracking through game-like mechanics adapted to educational contexts.

\textbf{Experience Points and Ranks.} \textit{Experience Points} (XP) serve as the fundamental currency of progress within the platform, earned through completion of various educational activities. The \textit{Rank} system establishes hierarchical progression levels based on accumulated XP, including ranks such as Newbie (entry level at 0 XP), Rookie, Skilled Expert, Master, and Legendary. Faculty members can configure rank thresholds dynamically, with each rank unlocking new privileges and recognition within the platform.

\textbf{Quests.} \textit{Quests} represent the core educational activities that students complete to earn XP and demonstrate learning. The system categorizes quests into five distinct types: Class Attendance, Practical Assignment, Quiz, Exercise, and Event. Each quest can be designated as mandatory (milestone quests) or optional, providing flexibility in curriculum design while maintaining educational objectives.

\textbf{Last Chances.} The \textit{Last Chance} mechanism provides opportunities for recovery and continued engagement when students fall behind or make mistakes, preventing permanent failure states that could lead to disengagement and ensuring continued participation throughout the academic term.

\subsection{Social Learning Framework}

The social components of the Learning Scorecard foster collaboration and healthy competition among students through structured group dynamics.

\textbf{Alliances.} \textit{Alliances} function as large-scale organizational units that typically correspond to academic classes or programs (e.g., LEI or ETI). These structures facilitate competition and comparison at the class level while maintaining educational coherence, enabling students to compare their progress through dedicated leaderboards and participate in alliance-specific activities.

\textbf{Guilds.} \textit{Guilds} represent smaller collaborative units within alliances, typically corresponding to project teams or study groups. The guild system promotes cooperative learning by encouraging mutual assistance among members, with guild-specific achievements, badges, and leaderboards fostering team spirit while maintaining individual accountability within the collaborative framework.

\subsection{Recognition and Achievement System}

The recognition framework provides multiple pathways for acknowledging student accomplishments and maintaining motivation through visible achievements.

\textbf{Badges.} The \textit{Badge} system provides targeted recognition for specific accomplishments and behaviors, featuring 39 different badges organized into four categories: individual achievements, guild-based accomplishments, forum participation, and final questionnaire completion. Each category includes multiple tiers (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum) corresponding to increasing levels of difficulty and commitment.

\textbf{Trophies.} \textit{Trophies} represent the highest level of achievement, awarded to top performers in various leaderboard categories including overall rankings (Best Score Player), guild performance (Best Guild), and combined metrics (Best Triathlon Player). Each trophy provides substantial XP rewards (typically 1000 XP) and serves as a highly visible symbol of excellence.

\textbf{Avatars.} The \textit{Avatar} system enables profile customization while serving as a visual indicator of progression. Students unlock new avatar options as they advance through rank levels, with both male and female options available at each tier, allowing for personal expression while maintaining the connection between visual representation and academic achievement.

\textbf{Leaderboards.} Multiple \textit{Leaderboard} systems enable various forms of competition and comparison through five distinct categories: overall individual rankings, guild-based comparisons, exercise-specific performance, quiz results, and combined metrics. Each leaderboard displays position, username, rank, avatar, and XP totals, creating transparency in academic performance while fostering healthy competition among participants.

\subsection{Monitoring and Analytics}

\subsubsection{Student Dashboard}
\paragraph\ The student dashboard serves as the central interface for progress monitoring and decision-making.
Students can view their advancement across different quest types, track XP accumulation, monitor rank progression, and analyze their performance relative to peers.
The dashboard integrates all gamification elements into a cohesive user experience.

\subsubsection{History Tracking}
\paragraph\ The platform maintains comprehensive records of all student activities and achievements.
The history system allows students to review their XP gains from each quest, track their progression over time, and understand the relationship between their efforts and outcomes.

\subsection{Faculty Management}

\subsubsection{Quest Configuration}
\paragraph\ Faculty members can create and manage quests through both individual interfaces and bulk Excel imports.
The system allows for dynamic quest addition throughout the term, enabling responsive curriculum adjustment based on student needs and learning objectives.

\subsubsection{Rank and XP Configuration}
\paragraph\ Instructors have comprehensive control over rank thresholds and XP distribution.
This flexibility enables adaptation to different course structures, student populations, and learning objectives while maintaining game balance and engagement.

\subsection{Assessment Integration}

\subsubsection{Continuous Assessment Connection}
\paragraph\ The gamification system integrates directly with academic assessment, allowing XP and rank progression to contribute to final course grades.
This connection ensures that game mechanics support rather than distract from educational objectives.

\subsubsection{Difficulty and Challenge Scaling}
\paragraph\ The platform incorporates mechanisms for adjusting challenge levels and providing appropriate difficulty progression.
This ensures that all students can find appropriate challenges while maintaining engagement across diverse skill levels and learning paces.
